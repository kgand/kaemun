The database is already made, if for some reason it isn't go to UserDatabase.py, uncomment the createDB() method and run
the file then comment the line out again. The UI is simple, click login to login, register to register especially if the
database is empty. If you register and login successfully you will be taken to the directory list and will allow you in
if you have the proper clearance level.
